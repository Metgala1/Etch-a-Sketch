# Etch-a-Sketch
For this new project i will start by creating. Agrid container this will container 16 square divs on a single row and 16 div on a single column.

this divs will be in a parent div called grid-container.

i started by creating the grid-container in my html.
then using javascript i created a function called createGrid which takes in a number and create the grid based on that number.

to do this i had to use a loop to iterate and created the desired amount of squares. 

after creating the i had to append them to to grid-container,
